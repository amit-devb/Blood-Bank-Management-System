# Blood-Bank-Management-System
Bloodshala is a blood bank management system made by using Codeigniter, Bootstrap,JQuery, MySQL and CSS3.

I want every one to make it better by debugging the code as it is not stable yet.

Please contribute and help me learn new ways, and make this project much bigger than what it is now.

For installing it you just have download the zip file and paste it in your root directory, example- for LAMP: In var/www/html.

The concpet is that there are two users, Hospital and Receiver, they both have registration and Login page. The receiver has to register before requesting a blood sapmle.
The hospital accepts the request and provide the receiver with neccessary blood sample.

Import the sql file, after importing you can see the password as I did not use any encryption.

Thank You
